            <p>Apollo came to Shy Wolf as an Emergency Rescure request back in 2021. He was sad at first but greatful
                for the attention, love, and food he was recieving at Shy Wolf. Despite the fact that Apollo is deaf, he
                is an Ambasador for the Shy Wolf Sancturay.<br>To learn more about Apollo, click <a

            <p>Bob Leo is a bobcat who was brought to Shy Wolf in Febuary of 2021. He had been purchased when he was a
                kitten, and for 8 years he lived indoors, not really able to get the exercise he needed. Adjusting to
                the sanctuary was hard, he was depressed and stressed out, often refusing to eat. Through some TLC and
                vitamin B shots, Bob Leo was able to get back to eating and is finally warming up to the new
                environment.</p>

            <img src="imgs/Jasper.jpg" alt="Picture of Jasper">
            <p>Jasper came to Shy Wolf in 2015, after recieving a call from a couple that realized they were in over
                their heads with a wolfdog puppy and expecting a child. Shy Wolf took him in and had a DNA test for the
                pup and learned that his is 95+% wolf. Jasper hasn't warmed up to the others yet so he still lives alone
                in his own enclosure. He seems to be happy though and loves his toys.</p>

            <img src="imgs/Anja.jpg" alt="Picture of Anja">
            <p>Anja is a red fox that Shy Wolf recieved after her previous owners decided to move to a state that
                doesn't allow foxes as pets. This broke Anja's trust and she hasn't opened up the volunteer's at Shy
                Wolf. While she hasn't warmed up to her new home, people, and other animals around her, the volunteers
                at Shy Wolf still do everything they can to take care of her and enrich her life.</p>

            <img src="imgs/Mikey.jpg" alt="Mikey Leaning on his bridge.">
            <p>Mikey was discovered at Shy Wolf at such a young age, that he still had his umbilical cord attached. They
                guessed he was only two or three days old and took him in, as he likey wouldn't have made it on his own
                at that young of an age. He lives at the sanctuary, sharing his uniqueness with the residents, visitors,
                and volunteer staff. When he isn't playing with the other racoons or on the "busy board", he likes to
                hang out in the hammocks on of the volunteers made for the racoons.</p>
