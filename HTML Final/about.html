                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Teagan and I am the founder of this site. Ever since I was little, I have
                    had a fascination with wolves, foxes, and other wild animals. I liked to do research and learn about
                    them constantly. Growing up, i had always wished that I could volunteer at a sanctuary and/or a
                    rescue for wild animals. I never got the chance to unfortunately.</p>
                <p>After I joined the Marine Corps, my love for these animals didn't go away. I got to visit some
                    sanctuaries that had various wolf species among other animals like foxes, dingos, etc. It took me a
                    few years to figure out what I wanted to do in terms of a career long term. Eventually I settled on
                    Web Development, and with that, I birthed the idea for this website.</p>

                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>The idea for this site came from my love for wild animals and my appreciation for the sanctuaries and
                    rescues that help them. When I started learning web development, one of my projects was to create a
                    website, or rebuild one of my choosing. That was when the idea for this site came to mind.</p>
                <p>I had finally found a way that I could help the sanctuaries and rescues that I support. It can be
                    difficult for them to get the finances, food, and other resources they need to care for these
                    animals. So, I created this site to help them as much as I can.</p>
                <p>This site will be completely non-profit and will represent a different sanctuary every quarter. All
                    money donati0ons made will go straight to that sanctuary, as well as food and toys ordered on this
                    site will ship straight to the sanctuary. I will never hold onto the money as I will never see it.
                    That will go straight into their accounts. I do not hold the toys, going through me, you are
                    purchasing toys from an external site and they will automatically ship to the sanctuary.</p>
                <p>We hope that you will continue to support the represented sanctuaries. For questions regarding a
                    specific animals favorite foods or toys, please contact me by clicking <a
