            <h2>Teagan Embrey</h2>
            <p>She/Her</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p-5" id="intro">
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Front End Web Developer and Designer located in the Greater Portland Metropolitan Area. For the
                last three years, I
                have been attending Clark College, where I have learned a variety of coding languages, including some
                back-end languages like C and Assembly.</p>
            <p>Prior to beginning my journey in Web Development, I had served in both the Marine Corps and the Air
                National Guard. I got to do some traveling during that time and fell in love with Japan while I was
                there. The Japanese Culture and food quickly become something I admired and I can't wait to be able to
                visit again.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I like to play video games, attend Portland Thorns Matches, watch movies, and go for
                walks or runs with my dogs. I also enjoy exploring restaurants and finding new places to eat.</p>
            <h2>Values</h2>
            <p><strong>Honesty</strong> - Honesty is one of the most important things to me, both on a personal and
                professional level. I am one of those that will always own up to my mistakes, and if I don't know what I
                am doing, I will be honest and ask for help. Tact comes into play in this regard too, when approaching
                supervisors or managers with concerns about something they might be doing wrong.</p>
            <p><strong>Compassion</strong> - With all of the negativity in the world, and the negativity I faced during
                my time in the service, compassion became a huge part of my demeanor. People make mistakes, and rather
                than getting mad and making a big deal of the situation, I believe in taking the steps to help them fix
                it, and make sure they know that it's ok. Mistakes are bound to happen and no one deserves to be put
                down for the mistakes they make.</p>
            <p><strong>Humor</strong> - Humor should be a part of every work environment. In my experience, humor in the
                workplace has been key to relieving the daily stresses of the workplace. It's nice to have coworkers
                that can keep a positive attitude and keep some humor circulating in the workplace. That humor does need
                to be workplace appropriate but we all deserve a laugh. It makes the workplace a friendly and welcoming
                environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Attitude</strong> - The attitude and mindset you have when you come into work can have some
                crucial effects on yourself, as well as everyone else in the workplace. I believe having a good,
                positive attitude every day when you're at work. This can be hard sometimes, and that's why I do my best
                to keep my work and personal lives separate. This isn't always possible, so having coworkers that are
                kind, friendly, and positive can help influence our moods and attitudes while we are at work.</p>
